# Plant-leaves-disease-detection
1. The project focuses on identifying and classifying plant leaf diseases using Visual AI techniques, specifically employing Localization Activation Mapping to enhance the detection process.

2. Utilizes the PlantDoc dataset to train MobileNetV3-Large model to achieve accurate disease classification.

3. Incorporates advanced Visual AI methods like Grad-CAM, ScoreCAM to provide insights into the decision-making process of the models by highlighting the most relevant areas of the leaf images.
